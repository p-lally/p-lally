- 👋 Hi, I’m @p-lally
- 👀 I’m interested in computational and systems biology, as well as automating experimental processes, with a side interest in decentralized systems of establishing knowledge and funding scientific research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create lab inventory systems that facilitate experiment tracking and automated analyses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 📫 I can be reached via email at plally@bu.edu
